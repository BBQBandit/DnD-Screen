# DnD-Smartscreen
DnD Miniature detection and LoS rendering

Still very WIP but enjoy.

Screen- & Picture resolution currently have to exactly match the dimensions that are hardcoded in the beginning.
I added some pictures and the corresponding masks as examples. All Pictures are taken from Google.

How to use:
	After starting the program press "C" to calibrate the Screen/webcam setup.
	(Note: You can display the webcam feed, details as comments in the code)
	Then you can press space to search for minis and display their LoS.


Enjoy
